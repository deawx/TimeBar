      <h2>TimeBar</h2>
      <div>
        This is a jQuery plugin which enables selecting a period of time on a bar. I needed a simple component which allows the user to click a start and end time, 
        and I could not find a component that suited my needs, therefor I have build this component.<br>
        On the "<a target="_new" href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/libc225so/TimeBar/blob/master/demo.html" >demo.html</a>" page you will find some documentation and examples (view source to see how it works).
