      <h2>TimeBar</h2>
      <div>
        This is a jQuery plugin which enables selecting a period of time on a bar. I needed a simple component which allows the user to click a start and end time, 
        and I could not find a component that suited my needs, therefor I have build this component.<br>
        On the "demo.html" page you will find some documentation and examples (view source to see how it works).
